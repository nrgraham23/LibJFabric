Java bindings for the libfabric project.

This project is still very much in development.  It is NOT ready
to be used as it is incomplete and there are likely bugs and
memory leaks.

One of the major shortcomings of this project is the lack of good
error handling.  If these bindings were to be released for public
use, better error handling would be required.  At the moment, in
the case of an error, the code is likely to explode with no usefull
information.

To work on this project with eclipse, clone the git repository into
your working directory, and then create a new project in eclipse
called LibJFabric.
