Java bindings for the libfabric project.

This project is still very much in development.  It is NOT ready
to be used as it is incomplete and there are likely bugs and
memory leaks.

To work on this project with eclipse, clone the git repository into
your working directory, and then create a new project in eclipse
called LibJFabric.
